## Abstract
In this project, I analyze customer needs through text mining of
healthcare app reviews and based on this, I propose a design strategy
for healthcare apps. I have collected 34,230 reviews from 10 healthcare
apps in the Google Play Store. I performed LDA topic modeling to analyze customer needs in-depth through.

## Dataset
### 1. User reviews
> Collected 34,320 reviews from 10 health care apps in the Google Play Store

> Data Collection Method: Crawiling the reviews on Google Play store

### 2. Preprocessing
The dataset used for preprocessing purposes is as follows:

1. List for word substitution

Since LDA topic modeling provides results based on the most frequent vocabulary, unifying words with the same meaning into a single word is an effective way to perform semantic analysis on text. For example, 'iPhone' and 'galaxy s8' are both the same word as 'smartphone'. A human can determine that the words all have the same meaning, but the computer recognizes them as all different words. This may cause keywords to be missed because the number of occurrences of a word with a specific meaning is counted less as it is used as a different word even though it is a frequent vocabulary. Therefore, in text mining techniques where the frequency of occurrence of words is important, such as LDA topic modeling, prior word replacement is one of the ways to increase the effectiveness of data analysis.

2. List for stopword

A stopword is a word that appears frequently in text mining, but it is a predicate or investigation that is far from the user's reactions or opinions. They have nothing to do with user experience. Therefore, it is necessary to organize these stopwords well in the preprocessing stage.

## LDA topic modeling concepts

Topic Modeling is a text mining methodology that finds key topics in text-based document data. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the most representative algorithm for topic modeling. Specifically, LDA topic modeling analyzes which topics in a document and at what ratio by analyzing a large amount of document data through a probability-based modeling technique [(Blei et al., 2003)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com). In addition, since it provides information on what keywords are configured for each topic, it has an effective advantage in deriving insights through keyword combinations. Recently, research has been actively conducted in various fields, such as automatically classifying similar topics on SNS through LDA topic modeling or deriving customer needs by analyzing airline online reviews [(Lu et al., 2013](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6454769), [Kwon et al., 2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/2/78).

## LDA topic modeling visualization

In this project, considering the review rating is out of 5, I classified 4-5 as positive reviews and 1-2 reviews as negative reviews. LDA topic modeling will be performed and visualized for each review group that received positive/negative ratings, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below.
